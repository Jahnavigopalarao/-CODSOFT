This repository contains three machine learning projects completed as part of the CodSoft internship. These projects cover a range of tasks including binary classification, regression analysis, and multiclass classification.

## Projects Overview

### Titanic Survival Prediction

Objective: Predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin.
Techniques Used: Binary classification

Dataset: Titanic dataset

### Movie Rating Prediction

Objective: Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors.
Techniques Used: Regression analysis

Dataset: Historical movie data

### Iris Flower Classification

Objective: Develop a model that can classify Iris flowers into different species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.
Techniques Used: Multiclass classification

Dataset: Iris flower dataset
